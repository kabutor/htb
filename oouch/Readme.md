in Oouch you have to exploit Oauth, for that I did myself a script that does
all the process. Burp can help you, but when you have to do multiple petitions 
to differente points on a web, burp is not that helpful, that's why I came with 
this script, it helped me to try all the different steps up to the Oauth abuse.
